# Overview

This project demonstrates how to use the [Azure Storage SDK v10 for JavaScript Library](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-js) with Angular 7 to upload files to Azure Storage.  The project also demostrates how to set HTTP Headers that are not available *out of the box* in the Azure Storage SDK v10 for JavaScript Library.

## Technology Used

* Angular 7
* Azure Storage
